# Yay Chroot Shim

This is a set of scripts to allow building packages within chroots for Yay.

**WARNING**: this is just experimentation. The better approach would be to implement these
changes within Yay itself, but by using a shim, we might potentially be able to use this
as a standalone wrapper for makepkg + pacman itself.
